But here we are. This is my story.\nI had a server that was long overdue for OS upgrade. It had been running Debian 11 for long time, and rightfully so as the critical package was only supported on Debian 11. Today, I happen to do some maintenance and found out that I am now free to move to Debian 12. And thats when trouble started (why does this happen to me?)\nSo, I used apt to upgrade the packages, then the OS, and then finally the packages again just to make sure everything runs on the new OS version. All worked well. Sort off.\nI had a site that was running on Python-Flask-Gunicorn. Site was down. Logged in to check, to find that gunicorn wasn\u0026rsquo;t running. Okay, no biggie, I just go in and start the service. I got a bunch of errors saying that pip wasn\u0026rsquo;t available. Tried running pip manually, didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Exited the virtualenv, the OS version of pip was working fine. Nothing worked because the scripts were calling pip inside the virtualenv.\nSo, Hail Mary and decided to create a new virtual environment and run \u0026ldquo;pip install -r requirements.txt\u0026rdquo; (kids make sure your requirements.txt file is in working condition!). Made changes to my gunicorn helper scripts and viola! it worked! It\u0026rsquo;s alive!!!\nSo, today I learnt that OS upgrade breaks Python\u0026rsquo;s virtual environment. It seems (and I don\u0026rsquo;t know how) that the OS binding of Python has an influence to the virtualenvironment.\n","date":"9 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/venvbroke/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The day when my Python Virtual Environment broke","type":"posts"},{"content":" Another beginning # For most of you who knows me, you know I already have a master website. So why another one?\nSimplistic term, because I can!\nMore longer explanation, I wanted to declutter my brains. The main website serves as it is, a brain diarheaa of thoughts which is more structured towards work/cyber and general tech discussions. You\u0026rsquo;d see my thoughts and views on current and potentially future events. While that appeals to the general John Q. Public, I am very much a tech hands-on legs deep in mud kinda person.\nI started off my career being very technical, as in a keyboard junkie some might say, and true till today I still am. Doing all the tinkering, setting things up, learning more and more as I can. So I realised that knowledge, not used over time will erode. Connection between braincells deteriorate and I wanted an outlet which I could retain my learnt knowledge. Enter this site.\nWhy 2 and not 1? # I will be publishing in both, truth be told. I wanted the tech/config/deep stuff to be in a separate site so that it becomes easier when I wanted to search for things. Call it SR\u0026rsquo;s simple way of organizing information. Its also intended to keep some knowledge in my personal vault so that it\u0026rsquo;s accessible when I need it.\nAnd so it shall begin!\n","date":"1 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/genesis/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Genesis","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
